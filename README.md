# Photon Package Parser

A parser for [Photon's](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Photon) Protocol16.

## Requirements

### WinPcap
This library requires [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/) which comes with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

### Photon
Since it's using Photon you also need to download and link [Photon3DotNet.dll](https://www.photonengine.com/sdks#client-csharp).<br />
Alternatively you can also just link `Photon3Unity3D.dll` if you have a Unity based game.

## Example and usage:

I strongly recommend to use NuGet to [get the library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PhotonPackageParser/).

See an example [here](https://github.com/0blu/PhotonPackageParser/blob/master/PhotonPackageParser.Example/Program.cs).
